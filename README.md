## Artist Statement

Describe what you were trying to make:
!! This is a partially finish project for progress check !! 

I am trying to make a eco-town with mountains, forests, and rivers. 

## Straightforward Checks

Please list how your assignment fills the requirements. In cases where you have more than the requirements (e.g., 2,3,5,6) just list the most interesting ones. A short description (a few words) is probably sufficient. Leave blank or say "N/A" for things you didn't do.

Note: the other checks we can see easily.

2. 2 different kinds of objects that you made (just list 2)
    1. Cars 
    2. Houses 

3.  5 different kinds of objects beyond #2. (just list 5)
    1. trees 
    2. mountains (to be done)
    3. reflective ball 
    4. river (to be done)
    5. train (to be done)

5. 3 different behaviors. (just list 3)
    1. flying drone 
    2. train running 
    3. river flowing 

6. At least 3 objects must be "rideable"
    1. car 
    2. train 
    3. drone 

7. "train track" with a "train" (tell us how we know its a spline)
    1. (to be done)

8. One object from each category
    - buildings: Planning on building some houses, skyscapers, some churches, and so on
    - natural elements: mountains, trees
    - vehicles: bus, truck, cars

9. There is at least one model loaded from a file. (e.g. loading a `.obj` or `.fbx` file)
    1. I'm planning on loading some grass/tree/mountain model (using .obj)

10. There is at least one shader that you wrote.
    - what object is it on: I'm planning on using shader for grass
    - describe: to be done 
    - filename: to be done 

12. SkyBox or some other texture (list one - and say why you didn't have skybox if you don't have one)
    1. I used a sunny mountain skubox 

## Complexity Points

Describe each thing that you did that you think is worth complexity points.
(to be done)

If possible, order them from most interesting to least interesting.
(to be done)

Describe what the thing is, where we can see it, and why it deserves complexity points.
(to be done)

Note: put "####" (4 hash marks) and number the complex things to make it easier for us to identify them, but put the description on a separate line. We've given you the first 2 headers

#### Complex Thing 1:

#### Complex Thing 2:

## Screenshots

(you can find the screen shot of my first submission April 26th in the pcitures folder)
List the pictures that you made with a brief description

## Other Notes to the Graders

I didn't fill out everything because I'm still working on it. I built the road system, some cars, some trees, some houses, and a reflective ball. I will add more things to it as I continue working on this. 

## Attributions (including self-attributions)

to be done.
## Consent

The student consents to having their assignment shown in Galleries and Peer Review.

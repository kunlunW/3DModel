## Artist Statement

Describe what you were trying to make:

## Straightforward Checks

Please list how your assignment fills the requirements. In cases where you have more than the requirements (e.g., 2,3,5,6) just list the most interesting ones. A short description (a few words) is probably sufficient. Leave blank or say "N/A" for things you didn't do.

Note: the other checks we can see easily.

2. 2 different kinds of objects that you made (just list 2)
    1.
    2.

3.  5 different kinds of objects beyond #2. (just list 5)
    1.
    2.
    3.
    4.
    5.

5. 3 different behaviors. (just list 3)

12. SkyBox or some other texture (list one - and say why you didn't have skybox if you don't have one)
    1.

## Complexity Points

Describe each thing that you did that you think is worth complexity points.

If possible, order them from most interesting to least interesting.

Describe what the thing is, where we can see it, and why it deserves complexity points.

Note: put "####" (4 hash marks) and number the complex things to make it easier for us to identify them, but put the description on a separate line. We've given you the first 2 headers

#### Complex Thing 1:

#### Complex Thing 2:

## Screenshots

List the pictures that you made with a brief description
